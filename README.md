**The purpose of our research is to try to find a correlation between the life events that a certain singer went through, and the information culture he represents and shares with the world**

We will make a comparison for each singer between his life events in relation to three different sources of information:


1️⃣    The singer's lyrics

2️⃣    The pictures of the singer

3️⃣    The tweets he uploads on social networks



> First, we found blogs for singers in the form of unstructured information. We used a scraper tool so that we could analyze the blog pages and extract only relevant information.
The way we extracted the information from the blogs was to look for information attributed to a certain year. In this way we could create structured information:
Year - an event that occurred this year


> After that, we tried to see if there is a match between the events of the singer's life and the lyrics of his songs, his photos and the content of the tweets he posts on social networks.
